// src/lib/auth/backup.ts

// NOTE: The original functions (setBackupStatus, getBackupStatus) relied on the
// ODD SDK filesystem (WNFS) which has been removed.
// Implementing a backup status mechanism with the new crypto/IPFS/manifest
// system would require a different approach (e.g., storing a flag in the manifest
// or checking for specific backup-related data on IPFS).

// For now, these functions are removed to resolve runtime errors.

export type BackupStatus = { created: boolean } | null;

// Removed setBackupStatus function

// Removed getBackupStatus function

// You might want to re-implement backup status checks based on your new architecture later.
